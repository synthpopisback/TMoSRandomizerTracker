Controls work by window section, and are covered below:

Companions - Left clicking on a companion's icon will change that icon to full-color.

Items - Left clicking on either the armor, rod or sword icons will cycle through upgraded versions of those items. Right clicking will reset that icon back to its base value.

Map - Left clicking on a map marker will cycle through the icons in the top left of that map. '?' indicates an unchecked marker, 'X' indicates one that you do not need to keep track of, while Coronya represents the Time Doors and 'H' and 'S' are for Hotels and Shops, respectively. Chapters that have companions with prerequisites (and who are required) are also markable in case you do not meet their prerequisites when you find them.

Clicking on the Reset button will set all values back to their defaults, including map markers and item/companion icons.
